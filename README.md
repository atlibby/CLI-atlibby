# CLI-atlibby

This is a small CLI program written in the D language.

This program prompts the user to type something into the command line 10 times, 
after which it will calculate the average number of characters per argument and display
that to the user.

## Installation and setup (Mac OSX)

The simplest way (at least in my experience) to install and set up D on a Mac OS would be to
open the terminal and type in this command:

curl -fsS https://dlang.org/install.sh | bash -s dmd

This installs the DMD compiler for D onto your device.
